This is the original (pre Don Woods) version of _Colossal Cave Adventure_ written by Will Crowther. This version was long believed to be lost in the mists of time. The version included in this archive was found from a backup of Don Wood's student account and was made available by Dennis Jerz. Included in the archive are three versions of the FORTRAN IV source code, along with two versions of the game's data file. Also included here are FORTRAN 77 versions of the code. That conversion was done by Matthew Russotto.

**adventure-knuth-cweb.pdf**

Donald Knuth in 1998 used “Adventure” as his sole example in a 107 page tutorial on "literate programming"; theoretically meant to be coding for human readers as well as machines. His text carefully translates the Crowther/Woods FORTRAN code to CWEB, prefacing each section of code with a discussion of how the rules defined in each section of code affect the gameplay.

**advent.w**

This is the original Crowther/Woods Adventure game translated into CWEB form.
